node-lame
=========
### NodeJS native bindings to libmp3lame & libmpg123
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-lame.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-lame)

For all your async streaming MP3 encoding/decoding needs, there's `node-lame`!
This module hooks into libmp3lame, the library that the `lame` command uses, to
provide `Encoder` and `Decoder` streams to NodeJS.


Installation
------------

`node-lame` comes bundled with its own copy of `libmp3lame` and `libmpg123`, so
there's no need to have them installed on your system.

Simply compile and install `node-lame` using `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install lame
```


Example
-------

Here's an example of using `node-lame` to encode some raw PCM data coming from
`process.stdin` to an MP3 file that gets piped to `process.stdout`:

``` javascript
var lame = require('lame');

// create the Encoder instance
var encoder = new lame.Encoder({
  channels: 2,        // 2 channels (left and right)
  bitDepth: 16,       // 16-bit samples
  sampleRate: 44100   // 44,100 Hz sample rate
});

// raw PCM data from stdin gets piped into the encoder
process.stdin.pipe(encoder);

// the generated MP3 file gets piped to stdout
encoder.pipe(process.stdout);
```

See the `examples` directory for some more example code.

API
---

### Decoder class

The `Decoder` class is a `Stream` subclass that accepts MP3 data written to it,
and outputs raw PCM data. It also emits a `"format"` event when the format of
the MP3 file is determined (usually right at the beginning).

### Encoder class

The `Encoder` class is a `Stream` subclass that accepts raw PCM data written to
it, and outputs a valid MP3 file. You must specify the PCM data format when
creating the encoder instance. Only 16-bit signed samples are currently
supported (rescale before passing to the encoder if necessary)...
